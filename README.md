Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jeff Kayombo**, a product engineer from Lusaka, Zambia. Working in tech, a field that is rapidly evolving has helped me grow my intellectual curiosity and made me aware of the many challenges and opportunities around me. And as a result, I have developed a knack for solving hard problems, and working collaboratively with awesome people.

I'm building a company!
