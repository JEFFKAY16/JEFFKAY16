### What I'm working on

- I'm currently building **Typemint** - a platform that allows creators to collaboratively plan content with their subscribers.
- I also host a free workshop on **Sustainable Land Use**, an initiative aimed at helping local communities worldwide manage land in ways that prevent degradation, conserve natural resources, and protect biodiversity.

### Previous experience

- I worked as a product engineer at **DoubleGDP**, where I built software for over 40,000 residents across four chartered cities.
- I also worked as a software engineer at **Flare**, where I built software to help ecommerce merchants predict sales demand by saling items that are out of stock.
