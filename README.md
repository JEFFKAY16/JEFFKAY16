# Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jeff Kayombo**, a product engineer from Lusaka, Zambia. Working in tech, a rapidly evolving field, has helped me grow my intellectual curiosity and made me aware of the many challenges and opportunities around me. As a result, Iâ€™ve developed a knack for solving hard problems and collaborating with awesome people.

### What I'm working on

- I'm currently building **Typemint**â€”a platform that allows creators to collaboratively plan content with their subscribers.
- I also host a free workshop on **Sustainable Land Use**, an initiative aimed at helping local communities worldwide manage land in ways that prevent degradation, conserve natural resources, and protect biodiversity. So far, Iâ€™ve held three workshops at the **Wildlife and Environmental Conservation Society of Zambia**, where I interned during high school.

### Previous experience

- I worked as a product engineer at **DoubleGDP**, where I built software for over 40,000 residents across four chartered cities.
- I also worked as a software engineer at **Flare**.
